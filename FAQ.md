Growing up, I played multiple casual games on PC. I saw several great
titles, including time management (personal favorite),
hidden object, (basic) city development, and three-match.
On desktop, these were self-contained and had a limited number
of levels. Some contained fun reward systems for completing
levels on time, such as gaining castle pieces or
helpful upgrades. These are my favorite, and while
I played more games that focused on the levels themselves,
I felt (and still feel) inspired by these systems.

Times have changed, and its hard for me to play those
original games. A year ago, I discovered a website called [GameTop](https://www.gametop.com/)
that provides free downloads for casual games.
It all felt like Flashpoint, playing a role in
internet archival.

However, one game I tried significantly lagged on Linux
via Wine, on a _Steam Deck_. (Yes, you heard that right:
a 2D casual game pushed the fans on the _Steam Deck_).
Even if I used a PC, I realized that these games generally
have clunky UI, are stuck to **only** 32-bit,
and could suddenly break **without additional support**.
This makes sense for most games;
they are expensive to make, and long-term support is not
the main goal.

This is where Casual Cosmos comes in. The idea is to
fix these issues with an open source model. In addition
to keeping the genre alive, I want to _enhance it_,
making it more customizable than possible in
current mobile **and** desktop games.
